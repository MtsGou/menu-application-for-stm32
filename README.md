# Menu to the user, for STM32
A menu application for STM32 Microcontroller (STM32L476RG). This application offers a visual menu to the user, enabling the editing of variables of types int, float and string, through UART. This can be an aditional feature for a device.

The best way to use this is to clone it into your STM32CubeIDE workspace folder on your computer, in projects, and import the project in your STM32CubeIDE software. 

Also, check if all the C libraries are installed. Make sure the IDE is correcty installed and, before you compile the code into your STM32 board, MAKE SURE your MCU matches the model used for this project, in this case, STM32L476RG.

In case the MCU doesn't, match, the codes can still be used, so you can use the header and source files to only get the codes you want to use, and change as you'd like.
